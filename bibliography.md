# Bibliography / Reference Sources (Living)
This file is a living bibliography of external standards, guidance, and reference materials that may inform future data governance and data standards work. Resources listed here are not automatically adopted in WDG practice; rather, they serve as candidate sources to support consistent variable definitions, coding practices, and equity-informed data collection. Entries will be added and updated over time as new evidence, standards, or jurisdictional practices emerge.

### 1. Gender, Sex, & Sexual Orientation (GSSO) Health Information Standards - Government of British Columbia 
Link: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/practitioner-professional-resources/health-information-standards/standards-catalogue/gender-sex

**Summary:** 

A comprehensive provincial standard that supports inclusive, equitable, and high-quality health information practices related to gender, sex, and sexual orientation. The standard provides common concepts and definitions, recommended data elements, and practical guidance for implementation across health information systems. It outlines approaches to selecting and aligning technical artifacts from controlled clinical vocabularies and exchange standards (for example, SNOMED CT concepts and HL7 code values) to enable consistent data capture and interoperable data sharing across systems.

**Why this matters for WDG data standards:**

Although developed and formally adopted in British Columbia, this resource offers a strong, well-documented foundation for GSSO variable governance in WDG. It can inform:
- standardized local definitions and question wording
- permissible values and coding structures
- metadata expectations (e.g., distinctions among sex assigned at birth, gender identity, sexual orientation)
- interoperability considerations when sharing or comparing data across services or jurisdictions

**Local note:** Use as a reference point for developing or refining WDG-specific GSSO principles and variable standards, with adaption as needed to reflect Ontario context, local data uses, and community partner input.
